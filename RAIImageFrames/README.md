# RAI Dataset Frame Description

This directory contains frame images extracted from videos in the RAI dataset. Each image represents a continuous 5-minute segment of the video. The frames are arranged in chronological order, and key frames (shot start and end) are highlighted for easier analysis of the videoâ€™s structure and content.

## Frame Structure

- **Each frame image represents 5 minutes of video**: The frame images display video frames arranged one row per second, covering the duration of the 5-minute segment.
- **Key frame annotations**:
  - **Shot start frame**: Marked with a red rectangle, displaying the frame number.
  - **Shot end frame**: Marked with a green rectangle, displaying both the frame number and the shot index.

## Frame Naming Convention

Frame images are named sequentially in the following format:

    RAI-<video_number>-X.png

Where:
- `<video_number>` represents the video number, for example, `1` stands for video `1`.
- `X` is the frame image index. One image is generated every 5 minutes, starting from `1`. For example:
  - `RAI-1-1.png` represents the first 5 minutes of video `1`.
  - `RAI-1-2.png` represents the 5 to 10 minutes of video `1`.

Each RAI video corresponds to a `RAI-<video_number>.txt` file that contains shot labels, recording the start and end frames of each shot.

## Frame Image Source

## Notes

The frames are generated according to the actual frame rate and shot information of the video. To analyze specific content, please refer to the frame numbers and shot indices.
